# Image to Ascii Converter  
- Converts an image to an ascii version of the image which is written to a file where it can be copy and pasted  
- The `width` and `threshold` values that are passed into the `convert()` method can be changed - which could give a nicer looking (or worse) ascii version of the image  
- Written in python using the pillow library to open the file from the path
